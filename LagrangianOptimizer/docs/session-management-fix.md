# Session Management Fix

## Problem
When entering an equation in the equation input box and clicking save, the equation was not persisting across page reloads. The session management system had several issues preventing proper data persistence.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing GET Endpoint**: The server only had a POST endpoint for saving lagrangian results (`/api/sessions/:id/lagrangian-results`) but no GET endpoint to retrieve them.

2. **SessionContext Not Loading Data**: The `SessionContext` component only initialized the session ID but didn't load any saved equation data on page load.

3. **No Data Persistence Mechanism**: The `foundationEquation` state in SessionContext was local React state that got reset on page reload.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added GET Endpoint for Lagrangian Results
**File**: `server/api/sessions.ts`

Added a new GET endpoint `/api/sessions/:id/lagrangian-results` that:
- Fetches all runs for a session
- Transforms the data to match the expected format
- Returns the results sorted by creation date

### 2. Enhanced SessionContext to Load Saved Equations
**File**: `client/src/contexts/SessionContext.tsx`

Added a `loadFoundationEquation` function that:
- First tries to load pinned equations
- Falls back to loading the latest saved equation if no pinned equations exist
- Sets the loaded equation as the foundation equation in the context

Updated `initializeSession` to:
- Load the active session
- Call `loadFoundationEquation` to restore saved equations

Updated `saveEquationToSession` to:
- Refresh the foundation equation after saving to ensure consistency

### 3. Fixed Type Issues
- Removed `timestamp` and `pinnedAt` properties from foundation equation objects as they're not part of the `Candidate` type
- Used type casting where necessary to handle additional properties

## How It Works Now

1. **On Save**: When an equation is saved:
   - It's saved to the database via the POST endpoint
   - The foundation equation is refreshed from the database
   - The equation persists in the database

2. **On Page Load**: When the page loads:
   - SessionContext initializes and checks for an active session
   - If a session exists, it loads saved equations (pinned first, then latest)
   - The loaded equation is set as the foundation equation
   - The FoundationEquation component displays the restored equation

3. **Data Flow**:
   - User enters equation → Saves to database → Updates context state
   - Page reload → Load from database → Restore context state
   - Ensures data consistency between client state and database

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Enter an equation in the equation input box
2. Click Save
3. Reload the page
4. The equation should still be displayed

The session management now properly persists equations across page reloads by maintaining consistency between the database and client state.
